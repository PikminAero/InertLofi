This mods aims to replace Calamity's songs with Inert's covers.
So far, this mod includes:

- All Calamity bosses (except Exo Mechs, because Inert hasn't made a cover yet)
- All Calamity biomes
- Interludes songs
- And a new main menu style that plays Inert's cover of "The Tale Of A Cruel World"

This mod will be updated over time, as Inert releases new covers.
