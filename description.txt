This mods aims to replace Calamity's songs with Inert's covers.
So far, this mod includes:

- All bosses, except:
	- Providence
	- Ceaseless Void
	- Storm Weaver
	- Signus
	- Polterghast
	- Old Duke
	- Devourer of Gods (both phases)
	- Yharon (both phases)
	- Primordial Wyrm
	- Supreme Calamitas
	All of these are because I was not able to find a way to make it work... yet.
	- Exo Mechs
	...because Inert hasn't made a cover of this one.

- All Calamity biomes:
	- Astral Infection (surface and underground)
	- Draedon's Biolabs
	- Brimstone Crags/Azafure
	- Sulphurous Sea
	- Sunken Sea
	- Abyss layers 1, 2 and 4.
	Abyss layer 3 will be added when Inert releases her cover of R'lyehian Depths.



This mod does not yet replace the title theme and the interlude songs. I still need to figure these out.
